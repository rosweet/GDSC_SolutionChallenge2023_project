84% of the Korean respondents said that they had encountered hate speech online in the 2022 Public Awareness Survey on hate speech conducted on 1,209 people aged 15 or older nationwide. 
Among the hate speeches in the survey, 37.1% of them were "gender-related" hate expressions. 
This trend of society not only brings humiliation to the targeted groups of people, but also violates their freedom, security, and rights. 
The UN Special Rapporteur said, “The more hate speech is widespread, the more it becomes part of the mainstream and creates a permissive and toxic environment where calls for violence against the ‘hated’ group, 
usually a minority, become normalized. This propagation of hate against minorities online must be stopped.”

In addition, hate speech violates SDGs 4, 5, and 16 and undermines the continuous development of society. 

We attempted to create a technology that uses AI trained with Tensorflow to detect hate speech and analyze the natural language subtitles of a video. 
This technology changes the color of specific subtitles containing hate speech or highlights them on the video's play bar. 
Our goal is to raise awareness of the “existence” of hate speech, prevent users from being exposed to it without protection, and enable them to choose whether or not to skip over hate speech in the video.

Through this technology we created, we can make users aware of hate speech and prevent its negative effects of it, thereby realizing peace, justice, and gender equality in society.
In addition, a good education can be realized by preventing children from being negatively affected by video media.
